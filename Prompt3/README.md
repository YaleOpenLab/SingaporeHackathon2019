# Smart contracts for innovative fund and reward schemes for B-CAT pledges. 

### Background
On November 2018, DDL convened a design sprint in London collaboration with Oxford University. 
The sprint focused on discussing the merits and necessary architecture for the application of Blockchain for tracking action of Non-State actors —i.e. Blockchain for Climate Action Tracking, or B-CAT for short. 
With the outputs of this sprint, a team from Oxford University presented the B-Cat collective group to a running hackathon. 
The team has established an ongoing open source project to track and fund climate pledges by Oxford University’s colleges. 
See prototype at: www.commit-me.com. As part of the broader B-CAT project, the current efforts present clear opportunities to develop a hack that can take this project to the global stage. 
The work done by the B-cat collective, presents a user intuitive functionality for any peer to donate fund towards and existing climate action pledge. These funds (eg. in the form of cryptocurrencies) can be destined towards the costs of executing the projects associated to the pledges. However, a more interesting functionality, is the capability to allocate funds that can be retained as an escrow, and by issued as a reward to the responsible party/ies once the pledge is met. This enables multiple opportunities for innovation in economic models and reward schemes that can drive action and  behavioral change.
