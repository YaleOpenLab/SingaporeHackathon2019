In addition to producing electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind, we will greatly reduce our use of natural gas and petroleum. The majority of residents and businesses will be able to participate in the production of this clean electricity and share in the resulting prosperity, well-being and resilience of Boulder. By cleaning our energy system, we will reduce community emissions by 43 percent by the year 2050. Boulder will meet the target through it's efforts to municipalize it's electric utility, pursue a partnership with its incumbent provider, or through enabling state policy.. Local generation will be the cornerstone of Boulder's efforts to decarbonize, decentralize and democratize its energy sources. Boulder's efforts will focus on removing restrictions and barriers to adoption and local incentives. Boulder is also looking at opportunities for larger-scale investment through regulatory changes at the state-level.  In 2017 Boulder has over 20 MW of local soar and 15 MW of hydroelectric capacity.  Boulder intends to achieve installed capacity of clean electricity generation of 50 MW by 2020, 100 MW by 2030 & 175 MW by 2050."

This purchase puts Houston as the largest municipal purchaser of renewable power in the U.S., and in the top 10 overall in the nation, according to EPA estimates. The City has purchased renewable energy credits (RECs) that are Green-E certified.    Taking advantage of more cost effective and cost competitive REC prices, the City has maintained a relatively flat power price while also increasing its percentage of renewable energy in its portfolio.  In December 2015, the City of Houston signed an agreement with Reliant Energy, an NRG Energy company, to increase its purchase of renewable power through at least June 2016.  In 2017, the City negotiated another 12-month extension.  With this change, the Cityâ<U+0080><U+0099>s purchase of green power will account for 89% of its annual electricity demand.  The City will be using more than 950,000 MWh of green power per year, which is equivalent to the amount of kilowatt-hours needed to more than 87,000 homes each year.. 80% of the Cityâ<U+0080><U+0099>s energy coming from renewable sources and a 50 MW solar project soon to come online."

Required by Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS 701B). NV Energy - the state's investor owned utility, completed a 500 kV transmission line connection north and south grids in Nevada allowing renewable energy to flow back and forth. Currently, there is 1900 MW of renewables and portfolio credits come from geothermal, solar, wind, hydro, and biomass/waste heat and meet state requirements. Current Nevada RPS is 21% in Southern Nevada and 24% statewide. NV Energy is also completely divesting itself of coal and has shut down the last coal-fired power plant in Southern Nevada in early 2017."

In December 2010, then-Mayor Gavin Newsom announced a new goal for San Francisco: to be completely powered by renewable energy in 10 years. In pursuit of this goal, Mayor Edwin Lee, together with his predecessor, established the Mayorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Renewable Energy Task Force in January 2011, with the directive to develop recommendations for the City and County of San Francisco to achieve a fully renewable electricity supply for San Francisco. The Task Force, comprising local clean energy leaders, business and community stakeholders, and relevant City departments met nearly monthly from January 2011 through May 2012 to examine local and regional barriers to and opportunities for renewable energy, including policy, regulatory, technical, financial, and public awareness aspects. The Task Force produced a recommendation report that was released in September 2012. This report reflects the Task Forceâ<U+0080><U+0099>s discussions and recommendations for meeting the Cityâ<U+0080><U+0099>s 100% renewable energy goal.
